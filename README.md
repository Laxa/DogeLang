# DogeLang

DogeLang is a school project for our school.

We needed to create our own language which would implement procedural and object paradigms.

We needed to handle some object basics like : inheritance, polymorphism, attributes and methods.

We implemented LBNF grammar and used [BNFC](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc) to generate a Parser/Lexer.

We then transformed our language into compilable C language.
